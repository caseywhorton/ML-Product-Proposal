# ML-Product-Proposal

## Purpose

This repository contains an example machine learning model product proposal.

## Description

For the AI Product Manager Nanodegree program offered through Udacity, an AI or ML product proposal needs to be created by the student. I had an idea about a forecasting model for the usage of opioids by post-op patients. The product proposal needs to cover many aspects of the product including, but not limited to:

+ Data gathering
+ Mitigating bias
+ A/B testing considerations
+ Talent
+ Adoption
+ Go-to-market strategy
